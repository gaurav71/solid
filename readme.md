# SOLID Design Principles

This repository provides guidelines for achieving software systems that are **extensible**, **maintainable**, **modular**, and **easy to read**. By following the SOLID design principles, developers can create high-quality codebases that are adaptable to changing requirements and promote efficient development practices.

## Single Responsibility Principle

The *Single Responsibility Principle* (SRP) suggests that each function or class should have a single logical responsibility. By adhering to this principle, developers can improve code organization and enhance code readability.

## Open Close Principle

The *Open Close Principle* (OCP) states that code should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that adding new features to the system should not require modifying existing code. By designing software modules to be easily extensible, developers can minimize the impact of changes and maintain a stable codebase. OCP also facilitates easier testing and parallel development.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

The *Liskov Substitution Principle* (LSP) emphasizes that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for its base or parent class. This principle ensures that objects of a subclass can be used interchangeably with objects of the superclass. By adhering to LSP, developers can write code that is more flexible and promotes reusability. It also encourages programming to interfaces, enabling better decoupling and modularization.

## Interface Segregation Principle

The *Interface Segregation Principle* (ISP) advocates for keeping interfaces as lightweight as possible. Interfaces should ideally have a minimal number of methods, preferably just one. If multiple methods are necessary, they should be logically grouped together. This principle prevents forcing classes to implement functionality that they do not require. ISP is often considered as SRP applied to interfaces, promoting modular and maintainable code.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

The *Dependency Inversion Principle* (DIP) recommends that concrete classes should depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than on each other directly. This practice enhances loose coupling and promotes flexibility in the codebase. By programming to interfaces, developers can easily replace implementations and facilitate code extensibility and testability.

By following the SOLID design principles, developers can build software systems that are robust, adaptable, and easier to maintain. These principles serve as guidelines to ensure code quality, scalability, and modularity throughout the development lifecycle.
